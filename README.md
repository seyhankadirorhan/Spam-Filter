Real-time analysis of user input.

Minimal, user-friendly interface.

Responsive design for various screen sizes.

Technologies Used
HTML – Markup structure

CSS – Styling and layout

JavaScript – Logic and interactivity (spam detection using RegEx)

How It Works
The app checks the entered message against a list of regular expressions that match common spam phrases, such as:

“please help” or “assist me”

Money-related phrases like “1000 dollars”

Variants of “free money”

“stock alert” and similar investment-related terms

Fake personal appeals like “dear friend”

If the message matches any of these patterns, it is flagged as spam.
